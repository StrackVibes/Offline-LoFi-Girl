## Features

- **Video Background:** A looping video provides an aesthetic background.
- **Music Playlist:** Play a curated list of songs continuously.
- **Interactive Playback:** Due to browser autoplay restrictions, user interaction initiates music playback.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click the "Play Music" button to start the playlist.

## Usage

- Adjust the video: Replace `'Loop.mp4'` in the HTML file with your preferred looping video.
- Edit the playlist: Modify the `playlist` array in the HTML file to include your desired MP3 files.

## Notes

- Due to browser restrictions, the music playback requires user interaction. Click the "Play Music" button to start.
- This project is designed to work offline, providing an enjoyable experience everyone.

## Acknowledgements

- The idea and concept are inspired by the LoFi Girl project.
